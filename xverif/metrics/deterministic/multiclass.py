# Overall Accuracy Metrics
# - Confusion Matrix and Derived Metrics


# Class-specific Metrics
# --> One against the other --> All binary metrics
# --> Output contains the 'category' dimension

# - multiclass_mode="one-vs-all", "one-vs-one
# one-vs-all (OvR) - computes the average of the scores for each class against all other classes (macro/weighted/micro)
# one-vs-one (OvO) - computes the average of all possible pairwise combinations of classes  (macro/weighted)


# Aggregate Metrics Across Classes
# - Micro-average: Aggregate the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric.
# - Macro-average: Compute the metric independently for each class and then take the average, treating all classes equally
# - Weighted average: Take into account the class imbalance by computing the average of metrics, weighted by the number of true instances for each class.
# --> Output contains the 'averaging_method'  dimension
# --> Derived from the class-specific metrics
# --> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn-metrics-f1-score

# averaging_method
# 'macro':
# Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.

# 'weighted':
# Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).

# 'micro':
# Calculate metrics globally by counting the sum of TP, TN, FP, FN  (for each class) and then compute the statistics.

# --> Micro deals around the confusion matrix
# --> Macro and weighted can be vectorized (average of class-specific metrics)

# Multiclass model has one target feature, and more-than-2 (mutually exclusive) outcomes.

# Multilabel model has multiple target features, but each has a binary outcome (0 or 1)
# --> Verification of multilabel model not implemented
